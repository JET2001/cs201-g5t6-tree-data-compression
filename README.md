CS201 G5T6 Tree Data Compression

## Run the Project
To run the project, add your implementation of Utility in a different java package and modify the import in `App.java`. 

In the main directory, run 
```
.\compile-and-run.bat
```
MAC commands may be slightly different. If you are on MAC and this doesn't work, please add the mac version as well.

## Image files
Place the images in the root directory (NOT inside the `app/` directory). The paths to the folders have been modified in the package app (they have been prefixed with a `../` from the original code given.)
