# QuadTrees Implementation

Note this is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
There is a bug. 

Current Issues:
- I am struggling for cases where there the image cannot be divide into 4 subquadrants.
- I think that the quadrants seem to be overlapping, even though I don't explicitly define them to be overlapping, which is odd.
